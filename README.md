**Overview**

This repository contains the implementation of various digital logic circuits using Verilog. 
The repository showcases the design and simulation of fundamental combinational and sequential circuits such as Finite State Machines (FSMs), counters, adders, and more. 
The implementation serves as an educational resource for understanding different hardware description styles and simulation techniques.


The designs in this repository utilise Verilogâ€™s different descriptive capabilities, such as:


Dataflow Modeling: For synthesising circuits based on Boolean equations.
Behavioural Modeling: For describing circuit behaviour at an abstract level using conditional statements and procedural blocks.
Structural Modeling: For constructing circuits via explicit instantiation of gates and modules to represent their hardware structure.
